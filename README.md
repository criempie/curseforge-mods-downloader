# Mods downloader for curseforge modspacks.

## How to use

### You must have Java >=16

#### steps:
+ Download the file on the right the release tab
+ Put ```curseforge-mods-downloader.jar``` ```manifest.json``` in a individual folder
+ You can try to run the file by double-clicking, but in this case you will not see the console.
+  Otherwise, start the console, write ```cd <path to this individual folder> ```.
+ + Write ``` java -jar curseforge-mods-downloader.jar``` and wait for the program to finish.

##### In the end, you will have a ```files``` folder in which the successfully downloaded files will be located. You will also have a file ```log_result.txt``` which will show links to files whose download was not successful (this is most likely due to invalid characters in the link in the program). There are not many of them, so copy the links and paste them into the browser manually. Or, if the link does not work anyway, then find the mod on the Internet by the file name in the link.
